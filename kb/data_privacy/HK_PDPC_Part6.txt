(5)Subject to subsection (6), a data user shall not take adverse action against an individual in consequence (whether in whole or in part) of the carrying out of a matching procedure—
(a)unless the data user has served a notice in writing on the individual—
(i)specifying the adverse action it proposes to take and the reasons therefor; and
(ii)stating that the individual has 7 days after the receipt of the notice within which to show cause why that action should not be taken; and
(b)until the expiration of those 7 days.
(6)Subsection (5) shall not operate to prevent a data user from taking adverse action against an individual if compliance with the requirements of that subsection would prejudice any investigation into the commission of an offence or the possible commission of an offence.

(a)in the specified form;
(b)to the Commissioner; and
(c)seeking the Commissioner’s consent under section 32 to the carrying out of that procedure.
(2)Where 2 or more data users may each make a matching procedure request in respect of the same matching procedure, then any of those data users may make such a request on behalf of all those data users, and the provisions of this Ordinance (including subsection (1)) shall be construed accordingly.
(3)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), it is hereby declared that a matching procedure request may be made in relation to 2 or more matching procedures, or a series of matching procedures, and the other provisions of this Ordinance (including section 32) shall be construed accordingly.

(B)such of those matters in respect of which he is not so satisfied and the reasons why he is not so satisfied.
(2)For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that a consent in a notice under subsection (1)(b)(i) to the carrying out of a matching procedure to which a matching procedure request relates shall not operate to prevent a data user who is neither the requestor nor, where section 31(2) applies to the request, any data user on whose behalf such request was made, from carrying out, whether in whole or in part, the procedure.
(3)An appeal may be made to the Administrative Appeals Board—

(f)the user has taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to ensure that the data will not, in that place, be collected, held, processed or used in any manner which, if that place were Hong Kong, would be a contravention of a requirement under this Ordinance.
(3)Where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing that there is in force in a place outside Hong Kong any law which is substantially similar to, or serves the same purposes as, this Ordinance, he may, by notice in the Gazette, specify that place for the purposes of this section.
